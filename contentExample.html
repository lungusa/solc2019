<h3>Incidence</h3>
<p>Incidence is the number of new lung cancer cases diagnosed each year. The rate of new lung cancer cases in Connecticut is 63.5, about the same as the national rate of 63.0, and ranks 27th among all&nbsp;states.</p>


<!-- B -->
<h3>5-Year Survival Rate</h3>
<p>The percent of people still alive five years after being diagnosed with lung cancer (the survival rate) in Connecticut is 23.8 percent, much higher than the national rate of 20.0 percent, and 2nd among the 31 states with survival data. It is important to track survival rates in order to identify progress against lung cancer and where more efforts are needed to save&nbsp;lives.</p>


<!-- E -->
<h3>Stage at Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at later stages when the cancer has spread to other organs, treatment options are more limited, and survival is&nbsp;lower.</p>


<!-- G -->
<p><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400;">In Connecticut only 21.8 percent of cases are caught early when survival is much higher (65.3 percent). Unfortunately, most cases (50.4 percent) are not caught until a late stage when survival is only 5.1 percent. Stage at diagnosis does not add up to 100 percent because middle stages are not&nbsp;shown.</span></p>

<h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
<p>Lung cancer can often be treated with surgery as part of the first course of treatment if it is at an early stage and has not spread outside of the lung and lymph nodes close to the lung. While surgery may not be an option for every patient, those who receive it as part of their initial treatment have higher survival rates than those who do not. Patients who are not healthy enough to undergo the procedure or whose cancer has spread too far may not be candidates for surgery. Other treatments may be recommended instead of or in addition to surgery, such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy or&nbsp;immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Connecticut ranked 2nd (out of the 48 states with available data) with 27.4 percent of cases undergoing surgery as part of the first course of treatment, a much higher rate than nationally (21.0&nbsp;percent).</p>

<h3>Screening</h3>
<p><strong>Screening</strong> for lung cancer with annual low-dose CT scans <a href="/preview!www.lung.org/our-initiatives/saved-by-the-scan/" target="_blank">among those at high risk</a> can reduce the lung cancer death rate by up to 20 percent by detecting tumors at early stages when they are more likely to be&nbsp;curable.</p>
<p>High-risk is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>55-80 years of age;</li>
<li>Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking (this means 1 pack a day for 30 years, 2 packs a day for 15 years,&nbsp;etc.);</li>
<li>AND, are a current smoker, or have quit within the last 15 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>For screening to be most effective, patients must be able to access high-quality centers offering the service, such as those accredited by the American College of Radiology. Patients may benefit from a greater number of accredited centers in their state as can improve the chances of a center being nearby and their ability to get&nbsp;screened.</p>
<p>Connecticut ranked 3rd among all states with 9.5 accredited lung cancer screening centers per million people, better than the national rate of 4.8 centers per million people. This shows there are a high number of screening centers throughout the state available to the high-risk population in Connecticut. This increases the likelihood that an individual would have access to a screening center nearby and reduces a barrier to lung cancer&nbsp;screening.</p>

<p>Despite having a below average smoking rate, Connecticut has a lung cancer incidence rate similar to average. However, the state has more screening centers per person than average, which could contribute to both its much better than average rate of surgery during the initial round of treatment and much better than average survival&nbsp;rate.</p>
<p>Connecticut residents can lower their risk of lung cancer, as well as the risk of those around them, through these&nbsp;steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to your healthcare provider if you meet the high-risk criteria, and encourage others who meet the criteria to do the&nbsp;same:</li>
<li>If you or someone you know is ready to quit smoking, the American Lung Association is here to help. Our <a href="/preview!www.lung.org/ffs">Freedom From Smoking</a> program has helped over a million people quit smoking for&nbsp;good.</li>
<li>Higher tobacco taxes both encourage people to quit and prevent children and others from starting to&nbsp;smoke.</li>
<li>Well-funded tobacco control programs are an important part of helping people quit and keeping potential new smokers from&nbsp;starting.</li>
<li><a href="/preview!www.lung.org/cessationcoverage">Comprehensive coverage</a> of all FDA-approved smoking cessation medication and the three forms of counseling, with no barriers to accessing them, leads to more successful quit&nbsp;attempts.</li>
<li>Make your house and car smokefree air zones, with no smoking allowed. Avoid places that are not smokefree, and advocate for smokefree air policies in restaurants, bars, casinos or anywhere they are not in&nbsp;place.</li>
<li>Test your house for radon, and take steps to reduce your risk if levels are too high.</li>
<li>Reduce your exposure to unhealthy outdoor&nbsp;air.</li>
<li>Stay indoors on unhealthy air&nbsp;days.</li>
<li>Support clean air policies, including emissions limits and no vehicle idling&nbsp;zones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining a high number of quality, accredited screening centers will help ensure that both as many patients undergo surgery during their initial round of treatment and as high a survival rate as&nbsp;possible.</p>
