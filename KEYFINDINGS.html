<h2>LUNG FORCE: State of Lung Cancer</h2>
<h4><i>How does your state rank? Key Messages</i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>A new report from the American Lung Association, “LUNG FORCE: State of Lung Cancer” shows how the toll of lung cancer varies by state.</li>

  <li>“LUNG FORCE: State of Lung Cancer” examines five lung cancer indicators throughout the United States: incidence, survival, stage at diagnosis, surgical treatment, and o lung cancer screening facilities.</li>

  <li> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, accounting for about one in four cancer deaths.</li>

  <li>Anyone can get lung cancer. No one deserves lung cancer.</li>

  <li>More lung cancer deaths can be prevented:</li>
  <li class="liTwo"> Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and accounts for 90 percent of lung cancer cases, and the best thing to do is to never start smoking. But for the 36 million Americans that still smoke, quitting can be difficult. Through smoking cessation support, we can help millions of Americans end their addiction to tobacco and reduce their risk of lung cancer.</li>
  <li class="liTwo"> Radon is a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas that is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. Radon can build up to dangerous levels inside homes, schools and other buildings, and the only way to detect a buildup of radon in your home is to test.</li>
  <li> More lung cancer patients can be treated:</li>
  <li class="liTwo"> Early detection through screening has a crucial impact on survival, as does access to quality healthcare. Americans should be able to access the care they need, and your ability to access healthcare shouldn’t be determined by where you live.</li>
  <li class="liTwo"> Research has shown that screening for lung cancer can catch cases earlier and save lives. If the disease is caught before it spreads, the likelihood of surviving 5 years improves from 11 to 55 percent. Supporting awareness of criteria for lung cancer screening and availability of screening facilities, we can catch cancer at earlier stages – when it is more likely to be curable.</li>
  <li class="liTwo"> More treatment options are needed, as well as access to quality, affordable healthcare, so lung cancer patients can access these treatments. Through increased research funding we can find new treatments, and ultimately a cure for lung cancer.</li>


  <li>States must do more to protect their citizens from lung cancer. Governors and other leaders in every state have an urgent responsibility to act and implement proven policies to reduce the deadly toll of lung cancer, including passing smokefree laws; making sure everyone at high risk is screened for lung cancer; increasing access to quality, affordable healthcare, reducing tobacco use through proven prevention and quit smoking programs; and promoting testing of homes for radon.

  <li>What can you do to help fight lung cancer in your state? Sign the American Lung Association’s online petition to urge your Governor to make fighting lung cancer a priority.</li>
  <li>LUNG FORCE is a nationwide initiative led by the American Lung Association to unite women and their loved ones to stand together against lung cancer.</li>
  <li>The Lung Association is committed to a comprehensive approach to defeat lung cancer. Efforts in prevention, early detection, awareness, research and patient support all move us closer to making sure fewer people get lung cancer, and those who are diagnosed, live longer. Lung cancer survivors, caregivers and supporters are encouraged to join the nationwide initiative at <a href="http://www.lungforce.org">LUNGFORCE.org</a>.</li>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
<li> Incidence Rate – “State of Lung Cancer” shows that on average, the higher prevalence of smoking, the more lung cancer cases in a state. Greater targeted and national tobacco control and prevention efforts are needed to reduce lung cancer incidence.</li>
<li class="liTwo">Utah has the nation’s lowest lung cancer rates while Kentucky has the highest, which parallels the smoking rates in those states.</li>

<li> Survival Rates – Lung cancer has one of the lowest five-year survival rates among leading cancers because it is often not caught until a late stage when it is less likely to be curable. “State of Lung Cancer” shows that survival rates vary by state. </li>
<li class="liTwo">The five-year lung cancer survival rate was 20.0 percent nationally, ranging from 24.0 percent in New York to 15.9 in Louisiana.</li>
<li class="liTwo"> Only 31 states track this important metric, which should be implemented by all states to enhance monitoring of lung cancer,
as well as all other cancers.</li>

<li> Diagnosis Rates – “State of Lung Cancer” demonstrates that the stage at which someone is diagnosed with lung cancer varies by state. People diagnosed in early stages are five times more likely to survive.</li>
<li class="liTwo">Only 18.9 percent of cases nationally are diagnosed at an early stage when survival is much higher. The percent of cases diagnosed at an early stage was highest for Wyoming at 23.3 percent and lowest for Hawaii at 15.0 percent.</li>
<li class="liTwo">About half (49.8 percent)
of lung cancer cases are not diagnosed until later stages when survival is much lower. The percent of cases diagnosed at a late stage ranged from 41.1 percent for Arizona to 56.2 percent for Iowa.</li>

<li> Screening Centers – The availability of more lung cancer screening sites can increase screening access for patients at high risk, and have a positive impact on early detection and survival of lung cancer.</li>
<li class="liTwo"> Delaware had the most screening centers per million people at 21.1. while Utah had the fewest centers per million people at 0.7.</li>

<li> Surgical Treatments – Lung cancer is more likely to be curable if the tumor can be removed through surgery, and surgery is more likely to be an option if the diagnosis is made at an early stage before the cancer has spread.</li>
<li class="liTwo"> Nationally, 21.0 percent of cases underwent surgery as part of the first course of treatment, ranging from 30.1 percent in Massachusetts to 14.3 percent in Oklahoma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background on the Report</h2>
<p>The American Lung Association’s “State of Lung Cancer” 2018 is our inaugural report of key lung cancer statistics for each state. In this report, the Lung Association compiles key information on the burden of lung cancer and shows how the toll of lung cancer varies from state to state. The report is designed to capture the key data from each state in a snapshot to inform all stakeholders – patients, elected officials, advocates and media.</p>
<ul>
<li class="liTwo"> The 2018 report uses data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and American College of Radiology (ACR), among other sources. </li>
<li class="liThree">Most incidence, survival, staging, and surgical data are from NAACCR. </li>
<li class="liThree">Screening center are from ACR. </li>
<li class="liThree">The report also draws data from State of the Tobacco Control and State of the Air </li>
<li class="liTwo"> The “State of Lung Cancer” report will be available at Lung.org/SOLC, beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET on February 28, 2018.</li>
