<h2>Lung Cancer Rates</h2>
<h3>Incidence</h3>
<div class="box">
  <p>
    Incidence is the number of new lung cancer cases diagnosed each year.
    <span class="CHANGE">
      The rate of new lung cancer cases in Idaho is 51.4, lower than the national rate of 63.0, and ranks 7th among all states.

<h3>5-Year Survival Rate</h3>
<div class="box">
  <p>
    <span class="CHANGE">
      The percent of people still alive five years after being diagnosed with lung cancer (the survival rate) in Idaho is 18.5 percent, lower than the national rate of 20.0 percent, and 21st among the 31 states with survival data. It is important to track survival rates in order to identify progress against lung cancer and where more efforts are needed to save lives.

</div>






<h3>Stage at Diagnosis</h3>
<p>
  Most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at later stages when the cancer has spread to other organs, treatment options are more limited, and survival is lower.
</p>
<div class="box">
  <p>
    <span class="CHANGE">
      In Idaho only 18.7 percent of cases are caught early when survival is much higher (55.3 percent nationally). Unfortunately, most cases (54.7 percent) are not caught until a late stage when survival is only 4.5 percent (nationally). Stage-specific survival data is not available for Idaho. Stage at diagnosis does not add up to 100 percent because middle stages are not shown.

<!-- <a name="surgicalTreatment"></a> -->
<h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
<p>
  Lung cancer can often be treated with surgery as part of the first course of treatment if it is at an early stage and has not spread outside of the lung and lymph nodes close to the lung. While surgery may not be an option for every patient, those who
  receive it as part of their initial treatment have higher survival rates than those who do not. Patients who are not healthy enough to undergo the procedure or whose cancer has spread too far may not be candidates for surgery. Other treatments may be
  recommended instead of or in addition to surgery, such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="CHANGE">
    Idaho ranked 29th (out of the 48 states with available data) with 19.5 percent of cases undergoing surgery as part of the first course of treatment, a lower rate than nationally (21.0 percent).

<h2>Prevention</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Screening</strong> for lung cancer with annual low-dose CT scans <a target="_blank" href="/preview!www.lung.org/our-initiatives/saved-by-the-scan/">among those at high risk</a> can reduce the lung cancer death rate by up to 20 percent by detecting tumors at early stages when they are more likely to be curable.
</p>
<p>
  High-risk is defined as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>55-80 years of age;</li>
  <li>Have a 30 pack-year history of smoking (this means 1 pack a day for 30 years, 2 packs a day for 15 years, etc.);</li>
  <li>AND, are a current smoker, or have quit within the last 15 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For screening to be most effective, patients must be able to access high-quality centers offering the service, such as those accredited by the American College of Radiology. Patients may benefit from a greater number of accredited centers in their state
  as can improve the chances of a center being nearby and their ability to get screened.
</p>

  <p>
    Idaho ranked 17th among all states with 5.4 accredited lung cancer screening centers per million people, about the same as the national rate of 4.8 centers per million people. Although better than many states, this is still far below the 21.1 centers per million people in Rhode Island. This may indicate that lack of access could be a barrier to lung cancer screening for some in Idaho.

  <strong>Tobacco</strong> use is the leading risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking and second-hand smoke have both been shown to cause lung cancer.
</p>

<!-- changed from li to p -->
<p>
  <span class="CHANGE">
    The smoking rate in Idaho is 13.8 percent, lower than the national average of 16.8 percent.
  </span>
</p>

<p class="chartExplain">
  The line in the chart shows that, on average, each one point increase in the smoking rate for a state equals an increase of 2.4 points in the lung cancer incidence (the number of new lung cancer cases) rate.
  <span class="CHANGE">
    For Idaho the smoking rate is lower than the national average, while the lung cancer incidence rate is lower than what would be expected for this smoking rate, as shown by the Idaho data point being below the green line in the chart. This suggests that people living in Idaho might have lower exposures to other risk factors besides smoking.

      <strong>Radon</strong> is the second leading cause of lung cancer. Radon is a colorless and odorless gas that can seep into homes and buildings. Some geographical areas have naturally higher prevalence of high radon levels than others, but any home can have elevated
      levels. The US EPA has set an action level of 4 pCi/L. At or above this level of radon, the EPA recommends you take corrective measures to reduce your exposure to radon gas.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  <span class="CHANGE">
    Both the smoking rate and lung cancer incidence rate in Idaho are lower than average. Despite having an average number of screening centers per person, the state has both a worse than average rate of surgery during the initial round of treatment and a worse than average survival rate.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="CHANGE">Idaho</span> residents can lower their risk of lung cancer, as well as the risk of those around them, through these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Talk to your healthcare provider if you meet the high-risk criteria, and encourage others who meet the criteria to do the same:</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">If you or someone you know is ready to quit smoking, the American Lung Association is here to help. Our <a href="/preview!www.lung.org/ffs">Freedom From Smoking</a> program has helped over a million people quit smoking for good.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Higher tobacco taxes both encourage people to quit and prevent children and others from starting to smoke.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Well-funded tobacco control programs are an important part of helping people quit and keeping potential new smokers from starting.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><a href="/preview!www.lung.org/cessationcoverage">Comprehensive coverage</a> of all FDA-approved smoking cessation medication and the three forms of counseling, with no barriers to accessing them, leads to more successful quit attempts.</li>
  <li>Make your house and car smokefree air zones, with no smoking allowed. Avoid places that are not smokefree, and advocate for smokefree air policies in restaurants, bars, casinos or anywhere they are not in place.</li>
  <li>Test your house for radon, and take steps to reduce your risk if levels are too high.</li>
  <li>Reduce your exposure to unhealthy outdoor air.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Stay indoors on unhealthy air days.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Support clean air policies, including emissions limits and no vehicle idling zones.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Maintaining a high number of quality, accredited screening centers will help ensure that both as many patients undergo surgery during their initial round of treatment and as high a survival rate as possible.
